## initial impressions

This was not the first time I'd been to SPUR, but I will gladly gush about their space and coffee and demeanor and other things...  Their space is very minimalist with an attached co working space.  There is ample room to sit and talk, work, or study.  One of the coolest pieces of SPUR is the art that hangs on the walls, some of which belongs to businesses that rent there (presumably).  Regardless, it's a neat hang out in a great part of town to hang out in.

## ordering

I've only ever had efficient and friendly service at SPUR and this was no different.  I was able to order my drinks, even chat a bit about the coffee with the barista.  It was very enjoyable with no pressure or snobbery at all about my choices.  This is almost always true.  We discovered SPUR during my wife's last pregnancy and she was always able to get a guilt-free delicious decaf whenever she went.

## coffee

This isn't an entirely new review as SPUR uses coffee roasted at Sweet Bloom Roasters that I reviewed last [week](http://calm.coffee/sweet.bloom).  Still, every shop has their own settings and preferences that make it unique.  SPUR tends to keep things very close to how Sweet Bloom intended.  I ordered a decaf [Cortado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortado) and it was perfect.  It was a bit citrus-y in the foam and deepened as I drank it, showing me a more complex side of the roast than I got at Sweet Bloom.

## final word

Go to SPUR.  Buy Coffee.  Keep this "third-wave" trend rolling southward.  It's a great shop, very friendly and willing to talk about the coffee.
