## the setup

So I've debated a lot about what should be my first post.  I have quite a few visits and beans ready to go, but I decided to go with my most recent visit to Sweet Bloom Coffee Roasters in Lakewood.  

To start, I haven't been telling shops I was starting a blog or anything like that, so they didn't know it when I walked in.  I did this because I wanted a genuine experience and I also was a bit scared to (see the About where I mention my anxiety).  This is what followed.

P.S. There is a summary at the end if you're pressed for time.


## initial impressions

I'm used to specialty coffee shops in really unique buildings, but this was the most unique.  It is tucked away on a side street off Colfax in what looks like and old auto repair shop.  It's almost hard to see from the street.  When you walk in, you see what seems to matter most to them, their roasting process.  It's incredible.  The roaster was actively working on a batch as I was ordering and the other patrons seemed like this was just what happens here.  I thought it was incredible to see what was going on and feel like I was getting and inside look.


## ordering

When I approached the counter, I was greeted and then the barista went back to carefully preparing the pour-over for the person in front of me.  She was clearly passionate and answered all of his questions about the brew process.  It was my kind of place.  I ordered my decaf latte (which is a departure from my other shop reviews, more on this in other posts) and she went to summon another barista.  Who was just as polite and nice.  We made small talk about other shops using Sweet Bloom and where I lived and the shops in town.  It was great.  While they took their time making my coffee, they were also quick and efficient, leaving me with my coffee and the bag of beans I bought.


## the coffee

I'm still learning about tasting and notes and all of that, so I've been sticking to milk based drinks that doesn't overpower the coffee.  I feel like you can really tell a lot about a shop based on how much care they put into their milk.  

All that to say, I was very impressed by this latte.  It came with some great latte art that I forgot to take a picture of, but trust me, it was cool.  The initial taste has that brilliant lemon-y espresso taste you get from a great shot and the foam was awesome.  As the drink went on it was nice and balanced, with a deeper flavor than some other beans I've had.  I felt like it had a chocolate overtone to it.  It was well balanced enough that it still finished pretty clean and had a bright first taste.  I liked it so much that I bought the beans.

## final word
Sweet Bloom is a favorite of a bunch of shops I've been to, but seeing them in person was a treat.  The cafe is open from Monday to Saturday 7AM to 1PM, so it's more for morning people.  They are wholesaled into a ton of shops and they offer coffee, subscriptions, and more on their website.  I'll be back for sure and in a spoiler to other posts, I love their beans at home.
