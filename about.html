        <p> I came up with the idea for this blog right after going <strong>decaf</strong> to help with my anxiety.  I am a huge coffee fan.  I drank a ton, and I work in downtown Denver, which means I was drinking the good stuff.  I'd gotten to where I'd drive across town for a specific cup. I was pretty disappointed at having to miss out, but I noticed some shops had decaf on the menu.  I respected these shops and gave them a try.  It was great stuff.  None of my research had unearthed these places as great for decaf.  Most listed "top-10 best decaf coffees" but they weren't really up to par for the most part.  

This blog aims to change that.  It's going to chronicle my journey as I seek out great shops and great experiences while also drinking decaf.  I'm sure things will change and evolve as I learn more and things move along, but one thing will stay the same, a <emphasis>positive</emphasis> focus on places and brands that provide great decaf coffee.  That means I probably won't be writing negative reviews, I'll just not review those places.  This blog should show folks where <emphasis>to</emphasis> go, so that's what I'll focus on.</p>
