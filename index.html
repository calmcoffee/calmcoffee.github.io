					<h4>Not the <strong>I-have-a-kitschy-coffee-cup-my-aunt-got-me</strong> coffee lover.
					<br>
					An <strong>I-have-favorite-baristas-at-artisan-coffee-shops</strong> kind.  
					<br>
					The <strong>hand-ground-pour-over-set-up-in-my-desk-at-work</strong> kind.</h4>
					<br>
					<p>I also have very severe anxiety issues.  So I had to go decaf.  This site is what I wanted to find when that happened, a site that is devoted to good decaf coffee.  I have tons of fun ideas for the future, but for now, it's about what coffee shops and beans I find and their stories.</p>
